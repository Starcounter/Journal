# Development

Assuming you have `now` installed from [Zeit](https://zeit.co).

Edit what you need and and run `npm run deploy`

**Note:** You'll need to set two secrets for `now` (using `now secret add SECRET_NAME SECRET_VALUE`) 

```sh
now secret add client_id YOUR_GH_APP_ID
now secret add client_secret YOUR_GH_APP_SECRET
```
